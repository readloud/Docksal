We are grateful to all of our contributors in the many ways you give. Whether it
is by [code contribution](/credits) or by contributing financially through 
[Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/docksal) or 
[OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/docksal). Docksal is an invaluable
tool for us as well as our users. As a free and open source tool, we are grateful
for all of the support we receive to continue to improve and update Docksal
based on our users' needs.

When you contribute financially, you help cover the cost of hosting for documentation,
blogs, and the docksal.io site, the cost of hardware or software for 
testing and development, and the cost of developers' time for specific features.
